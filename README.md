This is a minimalistic and lightweight workframe for adopting the official KIT website design with static HTML pages and jQuery.
All the configurations come within one simple [config.yml](example/config.yml). Content of pages is separated in single [files](example/pages/).
The resulting pages are build from jinja2 templates with a simple python run.
