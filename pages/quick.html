# Quickstart
* get a clone of this repository: ``git clone https://github.com/particleKIT/StaticKIT.git``, optionally symlink the [./publish.py](https://github.com/particleKIT/StaticKIT/blob/master/publish.py) into a place withn your ``$PATH`` (e.g. ~/bin).
* initialize a new lecture template project with ``publish --init ~/.private_html lecture``
* for every page/template that makes use of variables/jinja2 syntax create a ``.html`` file at ``~/.private_html/pages/`` and fill it with your (html or markdown) content,
* every page that should be shown in the navigation needs an entry in the ``~/.private_html/config.yml``, the syntax is as follows: 
  
  ```
   navigation:
        - file: filename     # (without html extension)
          title: filetitle   # (the name shown in the navigation)
          order: 1           # (the position of the page in the navigation)
  ```
  
* run ``publish --input ~/.private_html --output ~/.public_html``
* thats it! The complete page is navigated from the newly created ``index.html``, all the jinja templates are proccessed with the objects from the config.yml.
* also have a look at the output of ``publish --help``
