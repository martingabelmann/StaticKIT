# Build your KIT .public_html webpage

This is a minimalistic and lightweight workframe for adopting the official KIT website design with static HTML pages and jQuery.
All the configurations come within one simple [config.yml](https://github.com/particleKIT/StaticKIT/blob/master/init/docs/config.yml). Content of pages is separated in single [files](https://github.com/particleKIT/StaticKIT/tree/master/init/docs/pages/).
The resulting pages are build from jinja2 templates with a simple python run.

## Requirements
 * python3 (python3-jinja2, python3-yaml),
 * a webserver with .htaccess support (optional).

## Usecases
Many institutes at the KIT provide a ``.public_html`` directory in the homedir of their members. There you can put static htmls only. Mostly, this leads to a chaos of many html files... 
The intention of this project is, to have a minimalistic framework for building simple website structures without batteling with thousands of html files and just concentrating on the content.
