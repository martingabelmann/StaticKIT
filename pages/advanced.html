## Infobox
You can add additional infoboxes on the right side of the page. Fill the ``infobox`` dict with appropriate informations, every new subdict (starting with a ``-``) marks a new infobox:
```yaml
infobox:
    - title: Info-Box
      text: "A simple list
          <ul>
          <li>item 1</li>
          <li>another item</li>
          <li>third item</li>
          </ul>
          "
    - title: Info-Box2
      text: "another infobox"
```
If you need more space and dont want to show the right column at all, simply set the ``showboxes: false`` variable the config.yml. 

## Linking your pages
Loading page content from specific files under ``/pages/*.html`` is triggered by appending a ``#filename`` (without .html extension) in the addressbar. Thus you can give others a link to one of your pages by copy&paste the resulting url from the navigation/browser address bar.


## Recycling variables
People using ansible (which mixes yaml and jinja2) may be confused, because standalone YAML does not come with a feature to substitute variables/strings.
However, we introduced a simple variable parser that treats YAML strings within the config.yml as Jinja templates:
```yaml
mail: "my@email.de"
text: "contact me at {{mail}}"
```
will lead to the desired result (i.e. "contact me at my@email.de").

## Markdown
You can use Githubs markdown ([showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) stricly speaking) when encapsulated in a div with the ``markdown`` class:
```html
<div class="markdown">
#this is a markdown page
we can use 
 * lists, 
 * _tables_, 
 * **formatting**
 * ...
here
</div>
```
For a detailed markdown description see the [showdown wiki syntax page](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/wiki/Showdown's-Markdown-syntax).

## placing Jinja2 templates outside of the pages/ directory
Sometimes it is useful to have other files as an template, too (e.g. for an .htaccess). Create a list ``root_templates`` in the config.yml and fill it with filenames relative to the document root (~/.public_html/). See the example project (``publish --init ~/projectpath``) for an explicit demonstration.

## copying static files with publish
Binaries and non-template files could in general directly placed into ``~/.public_html`` without informing ``publish`` about it. However, one might want to organize its template files within a version control system and/or want the whole webpage (including binarie content e.g. pdf downloads) reproduced by executing ``publish -o ~/.public_html`` while ~/.public_html is empty.
